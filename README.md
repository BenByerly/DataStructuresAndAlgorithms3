Creates a user interface to login as a user, create a user,  delete a user, or exit the program.

It does this by salting and hashing the password. 
Firstly it takes the user input, example users in the txt file. 
Takes username and password and creates the user, then it salts (meaning it takes a random word from the dictionary provided in the code and adds it to the password).
Then it hashes the password and saves the salted and hashed credentials.
